The *Crimson Text* Typeface
===========================

Crimson Text ("Crimson") is a free and open-source text type family.

For more info, please [check out the website](http://www.aldusleaf.org/0-crimson.html).


Directories and Releases
------------------------
While I have provided zipped "release" packages in the past (and will likely do so periodically in the future), the `Desktop Fonts` and `Web Fonts` directories above always contain the most up-to-date binaries, respectively.

`Desktop Fonts` contains both OTF and TTF versions of the font. While OTF is generally regarded as the more modern and powerful format, some Windows users may prefer the rendered appearance of the TTF files, at least for screen use.

`Web Fonts` contains subsetted (!) TTF, EOF and WOFF files. If the provided files do not meet the requirements of your website, which may well be the case, you will need to generate the webfonts yourself – using either a font editor like Fontforge or an online service such as fontsquirrel.com.

Contributing
------------
Contributions to the project in any form are very much welcome, and indeed encouraged! We always need help with:
* Improving/tidying up glyph outlines
* Correcting wrongly placed accents, messed up encodings, or making other language-specific fixes
* Writing comprehensive OpenType features
* Adding new glyphs to expand the coverage of languages, symbol sets, typographic niceties, etc.
* Ironing out spacing and kerning wrinkles
* Streamlining the build process from SFD (or UFO) to binary files.

I'm looking forward to your pull requests!
